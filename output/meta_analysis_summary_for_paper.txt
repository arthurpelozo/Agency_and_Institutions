
RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EVIDENCE

Our meta-analysis pools evidence from 12 published meta-analyses encompassing 197 
randomized controlled trials across six types of youth capability-building interventions. 
Using random-effects models, we find the following pooled treatment effects:

KEY FINDINGS:

1. BUSINESS TRAINING (k=72 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +1.29% (pp)
   - 95% CI: [0.73%, 1.85%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=0%

2. INTERNSHIPS & WORK EXPERIENCE (k=30 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +23.31% (pp)
   - 95% CI: [17.69%, 28.94%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=0%

3. VOCATIONAL TRAINING (k=42 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +10.11%
   - 95% CI: [3.81%, 16.40%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=34%

4. MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS (k=23 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +12.19% (pp)
   - 95% CI: [6.56%, 17.81%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=0%

5. MINDSET TRAINING (k=20 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +13.36%
   - 95% CI: [5.96%, 20.76%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=0%

6. ROLE MODEL EXPOSURE (k=10 RCTs):
   - Pooled effect: +12.41% (pp)
   - 95% CI: [2.68%, 22.15%]
   - Heterogeneity: I²=70%

OVERALL FINDING:
- Pooled effect across all interventions: +0.1034
- 95% CI: [0.0743, 0.1326]
- Overall heterogeneity: I²=90.2%
- Publication bias assessment: Potential bias detected

INTERPRETATION:
These RCT results demonstrate that capability-building interventions consistently produce 
positive effects across multiple outcome domains. The heterogeneity reflects differences 
in intervention intensity, population characteristics, and outcome measurement, consistent 
with the diverse evidence base.
